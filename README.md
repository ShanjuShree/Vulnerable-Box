I have created a vulnerable KING box and exploited as well. The box has multiple hidden flags in it which has to be captured by exploiting using peneteration testing techniques.
The clues are given in the flags names itself. I have also created a writeup manual for exploiting the box. Try capturing the flags before reating the writeup!!!
Download the KING box ova file which is attached inside the document. You can refer to the flags and credentials which is also attached as txt file.
